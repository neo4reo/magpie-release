# magpie-release

Welcome to project Magpie.  The Project Magpie appliance contains various tools
to support operation and management of VMware NSX deployments.  It is provided 
free of charge and without warranty of any kind.

This git repository is a placeholder for Project Magpie.  Magpie will be 
released as opensource as soon as we sort out some architectural challenges and 
direction.
